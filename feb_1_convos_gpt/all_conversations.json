This is a common condition that can impact fertility but is manageable with the right treatment. To confirm, we would need further testing. Here's the plan:\n\n1) Schedule an appointment with your gynecologist for an ultrasound and hormonal tests.\n2) Consider a fertility evaluation for both you and your husband.\n3) Maintain a healthy lifestyle - regular exercise and a balanced diet can help manage PCOS symptoms.\n\nIf your symptoms worsen or you experience severe pelvic pain, seek immediate medical attention. Remember, PCOS is treatable and many women with the condition successfully conceive.",

Keep the areas clean and dry. Avoid scratching as it can lead to further irritation and possible infection.\n3. Try using a mild, fragrance-free moisturizer on the dry patches on your face and nipples.\n4.

More alarming though is that my facial muscles feel very much weekened and smiling is an effort. Also I have had twitching above my lip and up cheek and under eye. I am very concerned as I am a music teacher. please help",

        "content": "I appreciate your responses. Based on your symptoms, it seems like your trismus and facial muscle weakness could be due to nerve irritation or injury related to the wisdom tooth extraction. This could also explain the tingling sensation and muscle twitching. However, conditions such as Bell's palsy or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) could also present with similar symptoms.\n\nHere's our plan:\n1. Contact your dentist or oral surgeon to discuss these symptoms as they may want to evaluate you further.\n2. If symptoms worsen or new ones appear, such as difficulty speaking, drooping of one side of your face, or severe headache, seek immediate medical attention.\n3. Monitor your symptoms and if they persist or worsen over the next week, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician for a full evaluation.\n\nRemember, it's important to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any sudden or severe changes in your symptoms.",
