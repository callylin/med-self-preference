    "reference_doctor_response": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although a personal physical examination of the lump would be helpful in reaching a nearby diagnosis, most probably with a history of trauma, it could be an organised hematoma on the left side of your back. To confirm the diagnosis, if I were your doctor, I would go for an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) followed possibly by an excision biopsy depending on the report of the FNAC.  Considering the duration of more than 4 years, clinically it might be a benign lesion not to worry about. However, for cosmetic reasons it might be required to be taken out.Therefore, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon and get your self assessed for the same.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.Since you have not mentioned relevant history and description like sex, pattern of hair loss(patchy/diffuse), family history etc, its difficult to put a definitive diagnosis. Still, it seems you are suffering from either Androgenetic alopecia (due to hormones and genetically determined) or Telogen effluvium (Due to any recent stressful event or any other medical condition)If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma /illness/ stress/ medications etc, your menstrual history and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.Also some other special tests like trichogram and dermoscopy can aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals (Tab. Follihair new) for minimum 6 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum/gel containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera, Grocapix etc). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel. Avoid blow dryers and hair-color/dyes. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Please continue your inhaler therapy. Make sure your technique of using inhaler is correct. Personally I would suggest you to use metered dose inhaler with spacer device, which ensures maximum drug deposition into lungs.2. Were I treating you, I would add daily montelukast and cetirizine/levocetirizine to your regular treatment. This will improve your both rhinitis and asthma symptoms.3. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing. This will help you identifying substances you are allergic to. The Allergist may suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy which will improve your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms.4. It's great that you have quit smoking. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Personally I would suggest you to learn and perform regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama, which will improve your lung capacity.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (e.g., adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sprouts, etc.) will also be helpful to you in long run.Ass you have asked about allergy treatment center in Bangalore, I must say there are some very good Allergist-Immunologists in Bangalore at present. You may choose any one of them depending upon your ease of travel.However, personally I would suggest you Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) where a lot of Allergy-Immunology work is going.Well, allergy-asthma are very well manageable and most persons with allergy-asthma can live absolutely normal life with appropriate treatment. So I would suggest you not to get depressed and have a positive attitude and efforts towards your health.Hope My answer will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."

He did an ekg and found nothing wrong, but I didn;t think it was heart related. He said he thought the pain was due to me eating spicy food or hot sauce, because I liked it. I took his advice for a little while and stayed away from spicy food..that didn t help I eventually went back for an annual physical and at that time had issues with my grown, specifically my area of my left testicle...he had no idea what it could be as he could not find any issues, including a hernia. but sent me to a urologist. I saw 2 different ones in a years time...one had me take medication for a hydrocele he thought. Took the medication, pain subsided. the pain came back, I went back to the same urology office, but a new doctor saw me as the last one had retired. he said my file said nothing about a hydrocele, but actually said I had a hernia and recommended changes to my underwear and added support. I did that for some time and stayed away from strenuous activity. The pain never really subsided and in fact it spread to my hips and upper thighs. During this time I went back to that same uriolgoist office and saw a nurse practitioner. She found nothing of substance and sent me back to my primary, who did another exam and could find evidence of a hydricele OR hernia and recommended a CT scan of my pelvic area. I had that done about a year ago and it was inconclusive. the pain subsided in that time and so I have not gone back as I have gotten no answers really. The pain now resides in my groin/pelvis area, outside part fo the hip and now in my knees. Although I have had lower back pain in the past due to a fall many years ago, I had never felt the pain/discomfort i do now even when my lower back pain flared up. In fact, my back pain has not at all been a factor during this time. There are some other factors, but that is the main journey I have taken. I am reaching out as I had a couple more recent symptoms. Spontaneous bloody noses and loose bowel movements. With the pain expanding and the new symptoms I am becoming more concerned. what steps should I take next.",

It can indicate cancer of bowel, pancreas, ovary, breast, liver and lung among many others. However it does not always indicated cancer in a person without symptoms.The concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals for neoplastic disease, and the diagnostic efficacy of CEA measurements in high-risk groups has not been established.
