    "reference_doctor_response": "in pregnant mother due to diabetes sugar will be high so baby will get more sugar so it will be producing more insulin.insulin is the prime hormone for growth in infants.{yes,not growth hormone:it s only after 5 years}up to 5 years  hormone:thyroxineso more insulin produced more chubby baby is.after deliveryMORE INSULIN:LESS SUGAR{BCOZ BABY IS OUT}so blood sugar lowit s not serious if baby is monitered regulated sugar regularlybut main effect will be the baby is going to be bit heavier side and most probably may get diabetes milletus in future.so advice is keep him on low glycemic index foods after 7 years",
    "generated_response": "A fast pulse rate and low blood sugar in a newborn can be concerning, but it\u2019s also a fairly common situation right after birth\u2014especially in babies born to mothers who had diabetes/\u201chigh sugar\u201d during pregnancy. Many babies do very well once their blood sugar is stabilized, which is why the team is observing him closely and may temporarily keep him in the nursery/NICU.\n\n### Why this happens (and why they\u2019re watching him)\nWhen a mother\u2019s blood sugar is high during pregnancy, the baby\u2019s pancreas often makes extra insulin. After delivery, the mother\u2019s sugar supply stops suddenly, but the baby may still have higher insulin for a while\u2014this can drop the baby\u2019s blood sugar (neonatal hypoglycemia). Low blood sugar can make babies jittery, sleepy, feed poorly, have breathing issues, or (if severe/prolonged) cause seizures, so hospitals monitor and treat it promptly.\n\nA \u201chigh pulse rate\u201d (tachycardia) can happen for several reasons in newborns, including:\n- Stress from birth/crying, pain, or being cold\n- Low blood sugar\n- Dehydration\n- Fever/infection\n- Breathing difficulty\n- Less commonly, a heart rhythm issue\n\nThe key is **how high the heart rate is, whether it stays high at rest, and whether there are other symptoms**. Observation allows them to sort this out safely.\n\n### Is it serious? Will he be fine?\nIt *can* be serious **if the blood sugar is very low, persistent, or causing symptoms**, but in many cases it\u2019s **temporary and treatable within the first 24\u201348 hours**. Most babies recover fully once sugars normalize and feeds are established. The medical team is doing the right thing by monitoring before sending him to mom.\n\n### What treatment usually looks like\nDepending on the sugar level and symptoms, they may:\n- Encourage early/frequent feeding (breast or formula)\n- Give expressed breast milk or formula supplementation\n- Use oral glucose gel\n- If sugars are quite low or not improving: give IV dextrose (sugar) and monitor more closely\n\nThey\u2019ll typically do **repeat blood sugar checks** until levels stay normal for a set period.\n\n### Questions to ask the team right now (these will clarify severity)\n1. **What was the baby\u2019s lowest blood sugar value (number) and at what time after birth?**\n2. **Is he having symptoms** (jitteriness, poor feeding, unusual sleepiness, breathing problems, bluish color, seizures)?\n3. **What is his heart rate when calm/asleep**, and is it improving after warming/feeding/sugar correction?\n4. **What treatment is he receiving** (feeds only, glucose gel, IV dextrose)?\n5. **What is the plan/criteria for returning him to mom** (target sugar levels, number of normal readings, observation time)?\n6. Was your sister\u2019s diabetes **gestational or pre-existing**, and was it **well controlled** near delivery?\n\nIf you share the sugar number and the baby\u2019s current status (symptoms, whether on IV glucose), I can give more specific guidance.\n\n### What your sister can do meanwhile\n- Ask if she can **do skin-to-skin** and/or visit the baby if allowed\u2014this can help with temperature and feeding readiness.\n- Start **hand expression/pumping** as soon as possible so milk/colostrum is available for the baby (the staff can help store and deliver it).\n- Ensure the team knows if there were any delivery complications (prolonged labor, fever, meconium, etc.), as these can affect monitoring.\n\n### Red flags (when to push for urgent attention/escalation)\nIn the hospital, ask for immediate review if the baby has:\n- Seizure-like activity, repeated jerking, or unresponsiveness\n- Trouble breathing, grunting, persistent fast breathing, or bluish lips/face\n- Persistent high heart rate even when calm, especially if associated with poor perfusion (very pale/mottled) or lethargy\n- Temperature instability (very low or fever)\n- Repeated low sugars despite treatment\n\n### Bottom line\nGiven the history of diabetes in pregnancy, **low blood sugar is a known and manageable issue**, and observation is standard. The most important factors are **how low the sugar was, whether the baby has symptoms, and how quickly levels normalize with treatment**. If you can provide the blood sugar value(s), the baby\u2019s age in hours, and what treatment he\u2019s receiving, I\u2019ll help interpret what it likely means and what to expect next.",

Available for further clarifications.Good luck.",
    "generated_response": "Blood in the urine after masturbation is not something to ignore, even if it\u2019s painless and goes away. The \u201ctight scrotum\u201d and pain just above the crotch (suprapubic/groin area) right after orgasm could be from muscle spasm, irritation/inflammation in the urethra/prostate/seminal vesicles, or less commonly a stone or another urinary tract issue that\u2019s being triggered by ejaculation. But **visible blood in urine (pink/red or clots) needs medical evaluation**, because the causes range from benign irritation to infection, stones, and (rarely in younger people) more serious urinary tract problems.\n\n### A few clarifying questions (your answers change what to do next)\n1. **How old are you?**\n2. Is the blood **definitely in the urine** (toilet bowl turns pink/red when you pee), or could it be **blood in semen** (pink/brown semen) or a small cut on the penis/skin?\n3. Does it happen **every time** you masturbate or only sometimes?\n4. Any **burning**, urgency/frequency, trouble starting the stream, weak stream, or feeling you can\u2019t empty?\n5. Any **fever/chills**, nausea/vomiting, or **flank/back pain**?\n6. Any **testicular pain**, swelling, redness, or one testicle sitting higher than usual?\n7. Any recent **new sexual partners**, unprotected sex, penile discharge, or STI exposure?\n8. Any history of **kidney stones**, recent hard exercise, trauma to the groin, or use of **blood thinners/aspirin**?\n\n### What this could be (most likely possibilities)\n- **Urethral irritation/trauma** from friction or vigorous masturbation \u2192 can cause a small amount of bleeding and discomfort.\n- **Prostatitis/urethritis (inflammation/infection)**, sometimes related to bacteria or STIs \u2192 can cause suprapubic/perineal discomfort and blood in urine or semen (may or may not burn).\n- **Bladder/urethral neck spasm** after orgasm (pelvic floor muscle spasm) \u2192 can cause the \u201ctight scrotum\u201d feeling and suprapubic pain; doesn\u2019t fully explain blood but can coexist with irritation.\n- **Kidney/ureter/bladder stone** \u2192 can cause blood in urine; pain can be variable and sometimes mild/episodic.\n- Less common but important not to miss: **structural urinary tract issues** (e.g., urethral stricture, bladder lesion). Risk is higher with age >35\u201340, smoking history, or persistent/recurrent visible blood.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\nBecause you\u2019re seeing **visible blood in urine**, you should arrange **in-person evaluation soon (within 24\u201372 hours)** with urgent care or your primary care clinician. If it\u2019s recurring, a urology referral is often appropriate.\n\nAsk for:\n- **Urinalysis and urine culture** (checks for infection and confirms blood)\n- **STI testing** (gonorrhea/chlamydia \u00b1 others) if any sexual exposure risk\n- Depending on results and your age/risk factors: **kidney/bladder imaging** (often ultrasound or CT for stones) and sometimes **urology evaluation** (especially if blood recurs)\n\n### What you can do in the meantime (until you\u2019re evaluated)\n- **Avoid masturbation/sex for a few days** to see if irritation settles.\n- If you resume, use **gentler technique**, adequate lubrication, and avoid prolonged/forceful sessions.\n- **Hydrate well** (aim for pale-yellow urine).\n- For pain: **acetaminophen** is safest while you\u2019re having bleeding. Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen) until you\u2019re assessed, as they can worsen bleeding in some situations.\n- Don\u2019t start leftover antibiotics\u2014treatment depends on the cause and correct antibiotic choice.\n\n### Go to the ER / urgent emergency care now if any of these occur\n- **Heavy bleeding**, clots, or urine that looks like **tomato juice**\n- **Inability to urinate** or severe worsening suprapubic pain/pressure\n- **Severe testicular pain**, swelling, or a high-riding testicle (concern for torsion)\n- **Fever**, chills, feeling very ill, or significant nausea/vomiting\n- **Severe flank/back pain** (possible stone) or dizziness/fainting\n\nIf you answer the questions above (especially your age, whether it\u2019s urine vs semen, how much blood, and any urinary/STI symptoms), I can help narrow the most likely cause and what testing is most appropriate.",

Do you have symptoms today: **vaginal burning, itching, unusual discharge, sores, or pain with urination**?\n\n## What to do right now\n- **Avoid sex (including oral) until it\u2019s clearer what this is and it\u2019s healed.**\n- He should **gently rinse with water only**, pat dry, and avoid soaps/fragrances on the area for a few days.\n- Wear **loose, breathable underwear**; avoid friction/masturbation until improved.\n- If it looks like simple irritation and is mild, a thin layer of **plain petroleum jelly** can protect raw skin.\n  *Avoid putting steroid creams or antibiotic ointments on open/unknown lesions unless a clinician advises\u2014these can worsen some infections or irritate further.*\n- If there are **true blisters/ulcers**, it\u2019s best he gets **seen within 24\u201348 hours** for evaluation and possible **HSV testing (PCR swab works best when lesions are fresh)**. Early treatment (if herpes is suspected) is most effective when started promptly.\n\n## When to get urgent care\nSeek urgent care today/tonight if any of the following occur:\n- **Trouble urinating**, severe swelling of the penis/foreskin, or foreskin stuck retracted\n- Rapidly worsening redness, warmth, pus, or severe pain (concern for bacterial infection)\n- Fever, feeling very unwell, or spreading rash\n- Large painful ulcers or significant blistering\n\n## If it\u2019s likely friction\nIf the spots are more like **raw/red irritated patches** and he has **no blisters, no discharge, and no systemic symptoms**, it may improve in **2\u20135 days** with rest and avoiding irritants. If it\u2019s **not clearly improving within 48\u201372 hours**, or if it worsens, he should be evaluated.\n\nIf you can, send a clear photo of the spots (good lighting, close-up but in focus) and answer the questions above\u2014then I can help you decide whether this looks more like friction/irritation versus something that needs STI testing right away.",

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although a personal physical examination of the lump would be helpful in reaching a nearby diagnosis, most probably with a history of trauma, it could be an organised hematoma on the left side of your back. To confirm the diagnosis, if I were your doctor, I would go for an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) followed possibly by an excision biopsy depending on the report of the FNAC.  Considering the duration of more than 4 years, clinically it might be a benign lesion not to worry about. However, for cosmetic reasons it might be required to be taken out.Therefore, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon and get your self assessed for the same.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef.",
    "generated_response": "A lump on the lower back that has been present for 4 years and is now \u201cbecoming a problem\u201d deserves an in\u2011person evaluation, even if it doesn\u2019t hurt. Many causes are benign (especially if it\u2019s soft and slow-growing), but the key is to confirm what it is and make sure there are no warning features.\n\n## What it could be (most to less common)\n- **Lipoma (benign fatty lump):** usually soft, \u201cdoughy,\u201d mobile under the skin, painless, slowly enlarging.\n- **Epidermoid (\u201csebaceous\u201d) cyst:** often a firmer lump in the skin with a central pore; can stay stable for years; may become inflamed/infected.\n- **Chronic hematoma/seroma or scar tissue** from prior trauma: less common to persist for years, but possible if there was significant bleeding under the skin.\n- **Muscle herniation or fascial defect** (a bulge that may change with position/straining).\n- **Less commonly, a tumor of soft tissue** (most are benign, but we pay attention to size, depth, and growth rate because rare cancers can present as painless enlarging masses).\n\n## Clarifying questions (your answers help decide urgency and next steps)\n1. **Size:** About how big is it (cm/inches)? Has it been **growing**, especially recently?\n2. **Location/depth:** Does it feel **in the skin**, just under the skin, or deeper? Can you **move it** around with your fingers?\n3. **Texture:** Soft/rubbery vs firm/hard? Smooth vs irregular?\n4. **Skin changes:** Any redness, warmth, drainage, a visible \u201cblackhead/pore,\u201d or recurrent swelling?\n5. **Symptoms:** Any pain, numbness/tingling down the leg, weakness, fever, unexplained weight loss, night sweats?\n6. **Behavior:** Does it change size with **standing, coughing, or straining**?\n7. **Impact:** When you say it\u2019s becoming a problem\u2014**is it enlarging, rubbing on clothing, limiting movement, or causing pressure when you lie down?**\n\n## What I recommend now\n1. **Schedule an in-person visit** with your primary care clinician (or a dermatology/general surgery visit) specifically for a **mass evaluation**. A hands-on exam is important to determine whether it\u2019s superficial vs deep and whether it\u2019s consistent with a lipoma/cyst.\n2. **Ask about imaging.** In many cases, the first test is:\n   - **Ultrasound** (good for distinguishing cyst vs lipoma and assessing depth), or\n   - **MRI** if it\u2019s large, deep, fixed, or has concerning features.\n3. **Measure and document it at home today:**\n   - Use a tape measure and write down the **largest diameter** (and ideally take a photo with a ruler for reference).\n   - Note whether it feels **mobile** and whether it\u2019s **soft vs firm**.\n4. **Avoid trying to pop/drain it** or deep massage\u2014this can inflame a cyst or irritate tissues.\n5. If it\u2019s mainly cosmetic or bothersome, and it\u2019s confirmed benign, **removal is usually elective** (office procedure for some cysts; minor surgery for many lipomas depending on size/location).\n\n## When to seek urgent care (same day / ER)\nPlease don\u2019t wait for a routine appointment if any of the following occur:\n- **Rapid growth** over weeks to months\n- **Size > ~5 cm (about 2 inches)**, especially if it feels deep or fixed (this should be evaluated promptly)\n- **Hard, immobile** mass or one that seems attached to deeper tissues\n- **New pain**, significant tenderness, redness/warmth, fever, or **drainage** (possible infection/abscess)\n- **Neurologic symptoms**: leg weakness, numbness, trouble walking, bowel/bladder control problems\n- Unexplained **weight loss** or drenching night sweats\n\nIf you reply with the size, whether it\u2019s soft vs firm, and whether it moves under the skin, I can help you gauge how likely this is to be a lipoma/cyst and how quickly you should be seen.",

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.Since you have not mentioned relevant history and description like sex, pattern of hair loss(patchy/diffuse), family history etc, its difficult to put a definitive diagnosis. Still, it seems you are suffering from either Androgenetic alopecia (due to hormones and genetically determined) or Telogen effluvium (Due to any recent stressful event or any other medical condition)If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma /illness/ stress/ medications etc, your menstrual history and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.Also some other special tests like trichogram and dermoscopy can aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals (Tab. Follihair new) for minimum 6 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum/gel containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera, Grocapix etc). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel. Avoid blow dryers and hair-color/dyes. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda",

    "reference_doctor_response": "if  you take my Advice then I would suggest you that yes you may be pregnant but still a confirmation is needed ,so go in for a urine pregnancy test as early as possible then you need to go in for an abdominal ultrasound to confirm your pregnancy",
    "generated_response": "Yes\u2014you *could* still be pregnant, even with a negative test today, but there are also several common non-pregnancy reasons for new spotting, especially after coming off Seasonique.\n\n### How the timing fits (based on what you shared)\n- Last period: **Jan 9**\n- Positive ovulation test: **Jan 24** (OPKs detect the LH surge; ovulation usually occurs ~**12\u201336 hours after** the surge, so likely **Jan 25\u201326**)\n- Spotting: **yesterday/today** (around **8\u201311 days after likely ovulation**)\n\nThat window is **exactly when implantation-related spotting *can* happen** (typically ~6\u201312 days after ovulation). So the timing is compatible.\n\n### What \u201cimplantation bleeding\u201d is usually like\nWhen it happens, it\u2019s typically:\n- **Very light** (often only when wiping, or a few spots on underwear)\n- **Pink or light brown** (can be light red)\n- **Intermittent**, lasting **a few hours up to 1\u20132 days** (occasionally a bit longer)\n- **Not progressively heavier** like a period tends to become\n\nImportant: many people who are pregnant **don\u2019t** have implantation spotting, and many people who have spotting are **not** pregnant\u2014so it\u2019s not a reliable sign either way.\n\n### Why your test could be negative and you still be pregnant\nEarly response tests can detect pregnancy before a missed period, but:\n- If implantation happened recently, **hCG may not be high enough yet**\n- If ovulation was later than estimated (OPKs aren\u2019t perfect), your testing may be **too early**\n- Urine concentration matters (first morning urine is best, but even then it can be early)\n\n**Best next step for testing:**\n- Repeat a home pregnancy test **in 48 hours**, and again **on the day your period is due** (or the day after) if still negative.\n- If you want the most definitive answer sooner, ask your clinician for a **quantitative blood hCG** (and repeat in 48 hours if needed).\n\n### Other common causes of spotting in your situation (differential)\nGiven you stopped Seasonique in November and cycles are still settling, possibilities include:\n1. **Hormonal fluctuations / cycle regulation after stopping birth control** (very common for a few months)\n2. **Luteal-phase spotting** (progesterone levels fluctuating before the period)\n3. **Ovulation-related spotting** (usually closer to ovulation, but can vary)\n4. **Cervical irritation** (sex, tampon use, pelvic exam; can cause light spotting)\n5. **Early period** (especially if your cycle is shortening)\n6. Less common but important if persistent: **cervical polyp**, **infection (BV/STD)**, **thyroid issues**, etc.\n\n### What I recommend you do now\n- **Track the spotting:** color, amount, and whether it\u2019s increasing.\n- **Avoid NSAIDs** (ibuprofen/naproxen) while you\u2019re unsure about pregnancy; use **acetaminophen (Tylenol)** if needed.\n- Continue a **prenatal vitamin** with **400\u2013800 mcg folic acid** daily (if not already).\n- **Repeat pregnancy testing** as above.\n\n### Clarifying questions (to better guide you)\n1. How old are you?\n2. Is the spotting **pink/brown** or **bright red**? Only when wiping or enough to need a liner?\n3. Any **cramping**, and if so is it mild/period-like or one-sided/severe?\n4. Any chance of **sex in the last 48 hours** (can trigger spotting)?\n5. Any **burning with urination**, unusual discharge, odor, itching, or pelvic pain?\n6. Have you had any prior **miscarriage/ectopic pregnancy**, pelvic infections, or endometriosis?\n\n### When to seek urgent/emergency care (red flags)\nPlease seek **urgent care/ER now** if any of the following occur:\n- **Severe or worsening abdominal/pelvic pain**, especially **one-sided**\n- **Shoulder pain**, dizziness, fainting, or feeling lightheaded (concern for ectopic pregnancy if pregnant)\n- **Heavy bleeding** (soaking a pad in an hour, passing large clots, or bleeding like a heavy period with significant pain)\n- **Fever** or foul-smelling discharge\n\nIf the spotting stays light and you feel otherwise well, it\u2019s reasonable to monitor and retest in 48 hours. If you reply with the answers to the questions above (especially spotting color/amount and any pain), I can help you interpret what\u2019s most likely and what to do next.",

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hi Welcome to HCM Read your prob, the cause of that small size bumb may be infection or inflammation of gland around it. you should consult with your doc n discuss it. do as per his advise , do not worry this is curable.",
    "generated_response": "A new pea\u2011sized single bump on the areola is often due to a benign cause (like a blocked Montgomery gland/oil gland, a small cyst, an ingrown hair/folliculitis, or a pimple), but because it\u2019s on the breast it\u2019s worth assessing a few details to decide whether home care is reasonable or if you should be examined soon.\n\n### Questions to help narrow this down\n1. How long has it been there, and is it changing in size?\n2. Is it painful, tender, itchy, or warm?\n3. What does it look like: skin\u2011colored, whitehead, red, dark, blister\u2011like, or wart\u2011like?\n4. Any drainage (clear, pus, blood) from the bump or from the nipple?\n5. Any surrounding redness spreading, swelling, or a \u201cboil\u201d feeling?\n6. Are you pregnant, breastfeeding, or recently stopped breastfeeding?\n7. Any fever, chills, or feeling unwell?\n8. Any new nipple inversion, persistent crusting/scabbing of the nipple/areola, or eczema\u2011like rash that doesn\u2019t improve?\n9. Any lump deeper in the breast (not just on the skin), or swelling in the armpit?\n10. Age, and any personal/family history of breast cancer?\n\n### What you can do now (if it\u2019s small and you feel well)\n- **Don\u2019t squeeze or pick it** (this can worsen infection/inflammation).\n- **Warm compresses**: 10\u201315 minutes, 3\u20134 times/day for 2\u20133 days.\n- **Keep the area clean and dry**; avoid friction (tight bras) and avoid new creams/perfumes on the area.\n- If it seems like a pimple/follicle: you can use a **gentle cleanser** in the shower; avoid harsh scrubs.\n- If it\u2019s tender, **acetaminophen or ibuprofen** can help (if you can take these safely).\n\n### When you should be seen (non\u2011emergency but soon)\nArrange an **in\u2011person visit within the next week** (primary care/OB\u2011GYN/breast clinic) if any of the following apply:\n- It **persists longer than 1\u20132 weeks** or is **growing**\n- It\u2019s **hard/fixed**, irregular, or you feel a **deeper breast lump**\n- **Bloody nipple discharge**, or discharge that is spontaneous (not only with squeezing)\n- **Persistent scaly/crusty rash** on the nipple/areola, especially if one\u2011sided and not improving\n- You\u2019re **not breastfeeding** and there\u2019s new redness/tenderness that isn\u2019t improving with warm compresses\n\n### Go to urgent care / emergency care now if\n- Rapidly spreading **redness**, significant swelling, severe pain, or the skin looks very inflamed\n- **Fever** (\u2265100.4\u00b0F / 38\u00b0C), chills, or you feel sick\n- A large, very tender lump suggesting an **abscess** (collection of pus)\n- Red streaking on the breast or armpit swelling with fever\n\n### Why this matters (brief reasoning)\nA single small areolar bump is commonly a **blocked Montgomery gland** or minor skin issue.

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Please continue your inhaler therapy. Make sure your technique of using inhaler is correct. Personally I would suggest you to use metered dose inhaler with spacer device, which ensures maximum drug deposition into lungs.2. Were I treating you, I would add daily montelukast and cetirizine/levocetirizine to your regular treatment. This will improve your both rhinitis and asthma symptoms.3. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing. This will help you identifying substances you are allergic to. The Allergist may suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy which will improve your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms.4. It's great that you have quit smoking. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Personally I would suggest you to learn and perform regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama, which will improve your lung capacity.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (e.g., adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sprouts, etc.) will also be helpful to you in long run.Ass you have asked about allergy treatment center in Bangalore, I must say there are some very good Allergist-Immunologists in Bangalore at present. You may choose any one of them depending upon your ease of travel.However, personally I would suggest you Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) where a lot of Allergy-Immunology work is going.Well, allergy-asthma are very well manageable and most persons with allergy-asthma can live absolutely normal life with appropriate treatment. So I would suggest you not to get depressed and have a positive attitude and efforts towards your health.Hope My answer will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards.",

But you have every chance of getting adjusted with any situation and lead a fruitful life.All the above episodes, symptoms and situations are generally called Anxiety issues.We are all social animals.The animal instinct of \"Fight or  in any situation is largely influenced by the interactions and past experiences we have with the environmental factors.We decide on either \"Fight\" or \"Flight\" based on our perception of the threatening factor and relating the past experiences almost to a certain extent. You may not be able to recall or bring back to memory some of the past experiences you had with regard to any situation or this situation in hand. We have some chemicals in the brain which regulate the animal instinct of FIGHT or FLIGHT. The irregularities in the secretion of these chemicals can be disturbing too.At present, it is my advice to avail the services of a Psychiatrist for some medications to bring back the equilibrium of the chemicals in the brain along with the services of a qualified Psychologist who can be able to patiently listen, interpret and render some therapy for a behavioural change.Good days ahead !Regards,Dr Rajesh Thottingal kalamRehabilitation PsychologistIndia",

    "patient_query": "Hi, I hit my funny bone very hard tonight. About 2 minutes after the pain started to diminish, I almost passed out. I then heard a very high pitch sound for the next few mins. My range of motion is not limited as I can t bend my elbow beyond 90 degrees. Why did I almost pass out and should I seek a dr to look at my elbow?",
    "reference_doctor_response": "Try to extent your elbow with your arm overhead, if you can do this then there is no fracture or major problem. In these kind of injury patient is unable to fully extend elbow with arm overhead.Try to do active elbow flexion extension exercises after pain gets fully subsided.",
    "generated_response": "Hitting the \u201cfunny bone\u201d (ulnar nerve) can cause an intense, sudden pain that sometimes triggers a **vasovagal reaction**\u2014your nervous system briefly drops your heart rate and blood pressure in response to pain/stress. That can make you feel like you\u2019re going to faint. A **temporary high\u2011pitched ringing** can also happen with near-fainting due to reduced blood flow to the inner ear/brain for a short period. If you recovered quickly and feel back to normal now, that explanation fits well.\n\nThat said, I want to clarify one key point: you wrote \u201cI can\u2019t bend my elbow beyond 90 degrees.\u201d That *does* sound like **limited range of motion**, and after an injury it raises concern for more than just a nerve \u201czing\u201d (for example a significant bruise, joint effusion, ligament injury, or less commonly a fracture).\n\n### Questions to help triage this\n1. Did you **fully lose consciousness**, even briefly, or just feel like you might?\n2. Any **chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations**, severe headache, or new neurologic symptoms (weakness, trouble speaking, confusion)?\n3. Is there **visible deformity**, rapidly increasing swelling, or significant bruising around the elbow?\n4. Where is the pain now\u2014**inside (pinky side)** of the elbow, outside, or deep in the joint?\n5. Any **numbness/tingling** in the ring and pinky fingers, hand weakness, or trouble spreading fingers apart?\n6. Can you **straighten** the elbow fully? Can you rotate your forearm (turn palm up/down) without sharp pain?\n\n### Should you be seen for the elbow?\nGiven the report that you **can\u2019t bend past ~90\u00b0**, it would be reasonable to get an **in-person evaluation soon (today/tomorrow)**\u2014and often an **X\u2011ray** is considered after elbow trauma when range of motion is limited, pain is significant, or swelling is present. Even if it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a bad contusion or nerve irritation, confirming there\u2019s no fracture or joint injury is important.\n\nGo **urgent care/ER tonight** instead of waiting if any of these are present:\n- Obvious **deformity**, inability to use the arm, or pain that is severe and worsening\n- **Rapid swelling**, a very tight/tense elbow/forearm, or escalating pain with finger movement\n- **Persistent** numbness/tingling in the ring/pinky fingers, hand weakness, or fingers becoming pale/cold\n- You **actually fainted**, hit your head, or you have ongoing dizziness, confusion, vomiting, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations\n\n### What you can do now (if you\u2019re currently stable)\n- **Rest** the arm; avoid leaning on the elbow.\n- **Ice** 15\u201320 minutes at a time, every 2\u20133 hours for the first 24\u201348 hours.\n- **Compression** with a light elastic wrap can help swelling (not tight\u2014fingers should stay warm/pink).\n- **Elevation** when possible.\n- Pain control: **ibuprofen/naproxen** (if you can take NSAIDs) or **acetaminophen** per label directions.\n- If bending past 90\u00b0 is painful, consider a **simple sling** for comfort, but try gentle motion within a pain-free range a few times a day to avoid stiffness\u2014unless a clinician tells you to immobilize.\n\n### Why you almost passed out\nMost likely: **vasovagal near-syncope** from the sudden intense nerve pain. It\u2019s common and usually benign if it resolves quickly and doesn\u2019t recur. If you\u2019ve had **recurrent fainting**, fainting without a clear trigger, or any heart-related symptoms, that warrants prompt medical evaluation.\n\nIf you answer the questions above (especially whether you truly fainted and whether you can fully straighten the elbow, plus any numbness/tingling), I can help you decide how urgently you should be seen and what injury is most likely.",

    "generated_response": "Masturbation (stimulating your penis with your hand) and ejaculating is very common and, for most people, does **not** cause long\u2011term harm. Starting in the teenage years is also typical. Washing your genitals with soap in the bath is usually fine, but **soap inside the urethra (the urine/ejaculate opening)** or very harsh scrubbing can irritate the skin.\n\n### Likely \u201cside effects\u201d (usually mild and temporary)\nThese can happen especially if it\u2019s daily or vigorous:\n- **Skin irritation/chafing** of the penis or scrotum (redness, burning, small cracks)\n- **Soreness** in the penis/pelvic area for a few hours\n- **Temporary swelling** or sensitivity\n- **Friction injury** if you use a very tight grip or no lubrication\n- **Guilt/anxiety** (common due to cultural/religious beliefs), which can affect mood or sexual confidence\n\n### Things that are *not* typically caused by masturbation\nMasturbation does **not** usually cause:\n- Permanent weakness, infertility, \u201closs of sperm,\u201d or reduced penis size\n- Erectile dysfunction by itself\nHowever, if someone uses very specific intense stimulation (very tight grip, very fast, certain porn patterns), it can sometimes lead to **difficulty climaxing with a partner** or needing stronger stimulation\u2014this is usually reversible by changing habits.\n\n### About \u201ccreampie comes out after bath\u201d\nIf you mean **semen comes out after you masturbate**, that\u2019s normal.\nIf you mean **fluid comes out later while bathing even when you did not masturbate**, that could be:\n- **Residual semen** leaking after a recent ejaculation (common)\n- **Pre-ejaculate** with arousal\n- Less commonly: **urethritis/prostatitis** (infection/inflammation) if there is burning, pain, or discharge\n\n### Practical recommendations (to reduce problems)\n- If you masturbate daily and feel fine, it\u2019s generally okay. If you get soreness, reduce frequency or intensity.\n- Use **gentler technique** and consider **lubrication** (water-based is safest).\n- Avoid getting **soap into the urethral opening**; rinse with plain water. If soap causes dryness/itching, switch to a mild, fragrance\u2011free cleanser.\n- If masturbation is interfering with sleep, work, relationships, or you feel unable to stop despite wanting to, that can be a sign of **compulsive sexual behavior**\u2014support can help.\n\n### Clarifying questions (so I can advise more accurately)\n1. Do you have any symptoms like **burning when urinating**, **penile discharge**, **itching**, **rash**, **pain in testicles**, or **pelvic pain**?\n2. Is the fluid you notice **white/thick like semen**, or **clear/yellow/green**, or **foul-smelling**?\n3. Are you sexually active with a partner? If yes, do you use condoms, and any risk of STIs?\n4. Are you having any issues with **erections**, **premature ejaculation**, or **difficulty climaxing**?\n\n### When to seek urgent care\nGet urgent/emergency care if you have:\n- **Severe testicular pain**, swelling, or one testicle sitting higher than the other (especially sudden onset)\n- **Inability to urinate**, blood in urine/semen, or severe lower abdominal pain\n- **Fever** with pelvic/testicular pain\n- An erection lasting **>4 hours** (priapism)\n\nIf you answer the questions above (especially about pain/burning/discharge and what the fluid looks like), I can help narrow down whether this is normal semen leakage/irritation or something that needs testing or treatment.",

    "patient_query": "Hello, I have seen my primary physician for some time now and he was goo up until about a year or so ago I had the following symptoms about 4 years ago I had dull pain located under my armpit areas. He did an ekg and found nothing wrong, but I didn;t think it was heart related. He said he thought the pain was due to me eating spicy food or hot sauce, because I liked it. I took his advice for a little while and stayed away from spicy food..that didn t help I eventually went back for an annual physical and at that time had issues with my grown, specifically my area of my left testicle...he had no idea what it could be as he could not find any issues, including a hernia. but sent me to a urologist. I saw 2 different ones in a years time...one had me take medication for a hydrocele he thought. Took the medication, pain subsided. the pain came back, I went back to the same urology office, but a new doctor saw me as the last one had retired. he said my file said nothing about a hydrocele, but actually said I had a hernia and recommended changes to my underwear and added support. I did that for some time and stayed away from strenuous activity. The pain never really subsided and in fact it spread to my hips and upper thighs. During this time I went back to that same uriolgoist office and saw a nurse practitioner. She found nothing of substance and sent me back to my primary, who did another exam and could find evidence of a hydricele OR hernia and recommended a CT scan of my pelvic area. I had that done about a year ago and it was inconclusive. the pain subsided in that time and so I have not gone back as I have gotten no answers really. The pain now resides in my groin/pelvis area, outside part fo the hip and now in my knees. Although I have had lower back pain in the past due to a fall many years ago, I had never felt the pain/discomfort i do now even when my lower back pain flared up. In fact, my back pain has not at all been a factor during this time. There are some other factors, but that is the main journey I have taken. I am reaching out as I had a couple more recent symptoms. Spontaneous bloody noses and loose bowel movements. With the pain expanding and the new symptoms I am becoming more concerned. what steps should I take next.",

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello,It seems to be muscular strain injury. For that, you can take rest and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen. A hot compress can apply for soothing. Avoid movement that causing pain. A chest x-ray is done to rule out any underlying fracture rib if present. Consult a physician for examination.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,    Dr. Parth Goswami",
    "generated_response": "Yes \u2014 you should be evaluated in person today (urgent care or same-day primary care). Given the direct blow to the center of your chest with an audible \u201ccrack/pop\u201d and now significant pain with deep breaths, sneezing, laughing, and arm movement, this could be a **rib or cartilage injury (costochondral separation), a rib fracture, or a sternal (breastbone) bruise/fracture**. Most of these are treated with pain control and time, but an exam is important to make sure there isn\u2019t a more serious injury (and to help you breathe comfortably enough to avoid complications like pneumonia from shallow breathing).\n\n### Why an in-person visit is important\n- The \u201cpop/crack\u201d plus focal pain after trauma raises concern for **fracture or cartilage separation**.\n- Pain that limits deep breathing can lead to **atelectasis/pneumonia** if you\u2019re forced to take very shallow breaths.\n- Less commonly, blunt chest trauma can cause **lung injury (pneumothorax)** or other internal injury, which needs prompt assessment.\n\n### Go to the ER now (don\u2019t drive yourself if you feel faint) if any of these are present\n- **Shortness of breath at rest**, worsening breathing, or you can\u2019t speak full sentences\n- **Chest tightness/pressure** not clearly tied to movement or pressing on the area\n- **Dizziness, fainting, new sweating, nausea**, or a sense of impending doom\n- **Coughing up blood**\n- **Rapidly worsening pain**, new one-sided chest/back pain, or new shoulder-tip pain\n- **Blue lips**, severe weakness, or confusion\n- Visible chest deformity, or you feel/hear **crackling under the skin** (air under skin)\n\nIf none of those are present, urgent care today is still appropriate.\n\n### What they may do at the visit\n- Check your breathing and oxygen level, examine the chest wall.\n- Consider **chest X\u2011ray** (to look for rib fracture complications and lung issues). Note: cartilage injuries and some small fractures don\u2019t always show on X\u2011ray, but the imaging helps rule out more dangerous problems.\n\n### What you can do right now (if you\u2019re not having ER red flags)\n**Pain control (helps you breathe deeply):**\n- **Ibuprofen 400 mg every 6\u20138 hours with food** *or* **naproxen 220 mg every 12 hours with food**, if you can take NSAIDs (avoid if pregnant, on blood thinners, history of stomach ulcer/bleeding, significant kidney disease).\n- You can add **acetaminophen 650\u20131,000 mg every 6\u20138 hours** (max **3,000 mg/day** if you\u2019re not sure about liver health/alcohol use; otherwise max 4,000 mg/day).\n- **Ice** to the tender area 15\u201320 minutes at a time, 3\u20135x/day for the first 48 hours.\n\n**Breathing care (important):**\n- Take **10 slow deep breaths every hour while awake**, even if uncomfortable (use pain meds first). If you have a pillow, **hug it against your chest** when you cough/sneeze to reduce pain.\n- Avoid tight wrapping/binding of the chest (can worsen breathing).\n\n**Activity:**\n- Avoid heavy lifting, pushing/pulling, and movements that sharply increase pain for now. Gentle movement is okay.\n\n### Clarifying questions (to guide urgency)\n1. How old are you, and do you have any lung problems (asthma/COPD) or are you pregnant?\n2. Is the pain **sharp and localized** to one spot you can point to, and is it worse when you press on that area?\n3. Any **shortness of breath at rest**, wheezing, or feeling like you can\u2019t get enough air?\n4. Any **bruising/swelling**, visible deformity, or pain radiating to the back/shoulder/jaw?\n5. Any fever, cough, or coughing up blood since the injury?\n\nIf you answer those, I can help you decide between urgent care vs ER. But based on what you\u2019ve described, I would not \u201cwait it out\u201d without being seen.",

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The normal value of CEA is less than 3 in healthy non smokers. It can indicate cancer of bowel, pancreas, ovary, breast, liver and lung among many others. However it does not always indicated cancer in a person without symptoms.The concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in serum should not be used to screen asymptomatic individuals for neoplastic disease, and the diagnostic efficacy of CEA measurements in high-risk groups has not been established. Single values of CEA are less informative than changes assessed over time. Please discuss with your doctor and get the test repeated after a few weeks and to check if it is a concern. Please do not worry.",
    "generated_response": "CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) is a **nonspecific** blood marker. It can be elevated with some cancers (most commonly colorectal, but also others), but it can also be elevated for **non-cancer reasons**. A value around **20 ng/mL** is clearly above typical reference ranges and **should not be ignored**, but it also **does not diagnose cancer by itself**\u2014especially when found on a screening panel without symptoms.\n\n### Could your C\u2011section 6 weeks ago affect CEA?\nPregnancy/postpartum changes can affect many labs, but **CEA is not typically markedly elevated just from a C\u2011section**. Mild changes can occur in some situations, but a level of ~20 warrants a structured follow-up rather than assuming it\u2019s from delivery.\n\n### Common non-cancer causes of elevated CEA\nThese are important to consider because they can raise CEA and sometimes explain moderate elevations:\n- **Smoking or vaping** (even secondhand exposure can matter, but active smoking is most associated)\n- **Inflammation/infection** (including recent infections)\n- **Liver or bile duct issues** (CEA is cleared by the liver)\n- **Inflammatory bowel disease**, gastritis, pancreatitis\n- **Benign lung disease**\n- **Hypothyroidism** (less common, but can be associated)\n\n### What I recommend doing next (practical plan)\n1. **Repeat the CEA to confirm it\u2019s real**\n   - Do it in **2\u20136 weeks** (sooner is fine if you\u2019re anxious, but waiting a couple weeks can reduce transient/inflammatory effects).\n   - Ideally use the **same lab** (results can vary slightly by assay).\n   - If you smoke/vape, avoid smoking before the test and tell your clinician\u2014smoking can chronically elevate CEA.\n\n2. **Review the full bloodwork and add a few targeted tests**\n   Ask your clinician to review:\n   - **Liver function tests** (AST/ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin)\n   - **Inflammation markers** if clinically indicated (CRP/ESR)\n   - Consider **TSH** (thyroid) if not already done\n   - Any signs of infection/inflammation postpartum (uterine infection, wound issues, etc.)\n\n3. **Clinical assessment + age-appropriate cancer screening**\n   If the repeat CEA remains elevated (especially if still ~20 or rising), the next steps are usually:\n   - A focused history and exam with your primary care clinician/OB-GYN\n   - Ensure you are up to date on routine screening:\n     - **Cervical screening (Pap/HPV)** as appropriate postpartum\n     - **Colon cancer screening** depends on age and risk (many start at 45, earlier if higher risk). Even if you\u2019re younger, persistent CEA elevation may prompt earlier evaluation.\n\n4. **If CEA stays high or increases: consider imaging and GI evaluation**\n   Your clinician may recommend:\n   - **Colonoscopy** (particularly if you\u2019re \u226545, have bowel symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, or persistent elevation)\n   - **CT scan of chest/abdomen/pelvis** or targeted imaging depending on symptoms and other labs\n   - Referral to **gastroenterology** (often the most appropriate first specialist for persistent unexplained CEA elevation)\n\n### Symptoms that would make this more urgent\nSeek urgent care (same day) or emergency care if you develop:\n- **Black/tarry stools**, blood in stool, or vomiting blood\n- **Severe abdominal pain**, persistent vomiting, or inability to keep fluids down\n- **Unexplained shortness of breath**, chest pain\n- **Rapidly worsening weakness**, dizziness/fainting\n- **Unexplained weight loss**, persistent fevers/night sweats\n- New **persistent change in bowel habits** (new constipation/diarrhea >2\u20133 weeks), or persistent pencil-thin stools\n\n### Clarifying questions (these change the next steps)\n1. What is your **age**?\n2. What are the **units** and reference range shown by your lab (e.g., ng/mL)? Was it exactly \u201c20\u201d or \u201c20.0\u201d?\n3. Do you **smoke or vape** (current or recent)?\n4. Any current symptoms: **blood in stool**, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, persistent heartburn, cough, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss?\n5. Were your **liver tests** (AST/ALT/ALP/bilirubin) normal?\n6. Any postpartum complications: fever, uterine tenderness/foul discharge, wound infection?\n\nIf you share your age, smoking status, the exact CEA value/units, and whether liver tests were normal, I can suggest a more tailored next-step plan (repeat timing, which tests to add, and how aggressive the evaluation should be).",

Some pulling/tightness can be normal as tissues heal, but **severe sharp pain** raises concern for complications that shouldn\u2019t be managed at home without being examined.\n\n### What could be going on (possibilities)\nI can\u2019t diagnose this remotely, but the main things we worry about at this stage include:\n- **Post-op complication at/near the repair**: irritation from sutures/tacks/mesh, nerve irritation/entrapment, or muscle spasm.\n- **Seroma/hematoma (fluid or blood collection)** or localized inflammation that can cause pressure and sharp pain.\n- **Recurrent or new hernia** (less common this soon, but possible), especially if there\u2019s a new bulge or pain with standing/coughing.\n- **Infection** (can occur even without dramatic skin changes early on).\n- **Bowel issue/obstruction** (uncommon but important): can cause significant pain, bloating, vomiting, inability to pass gas/stool.\n- **Other non-surgical causes** (gas/constipation from anesthesia/opioids, gastritis/ulcer, pancreatitis, kidney stone), depending on exact location and associated symptoms.\n\n### What you should do now\n1. **Contact your surgeon\u2019s office today (now if possible)** and tell them:\n   - \u201cTwo weeks post ventral + umbilical hernia repair, severe sharp LUQ abdominal pain and stabbing/pulling pain at the umbilicus, out of pain meds.\u201d\n   They may want to see you urgently, adjust pain control, or send you to the ER for imaging/exam.\n\n2. **If you cannot reach the surgeon promptly, go to urgent care or the ER today**\u2014especially if the pain is severe, escalating, or limiting your ability to move/stand upright.\n\n### Go to the ER immediately (do not wait) if any of these are present\n- **Fever** (\u2265100.4\u00b0F / 38\u00b0C), chills, or feeling acutely unwell\n- **Redness spreading**, warmth, pus/drainage, foul odor from incision, or rapidly increasing swelling\n- **A new bulge** at the belly button/repair site, especially if firm/tender or not reducible\n- **Persistent vomiting**, inability to keep fluids down\n- **Increasing abdominal distension**, **no gas or bowel movement**, severe constipation with worsening pain\n- **Severe pain that is rapidly worsening**, fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath\n- **Black/bloody stools** or blood in vomit\n\n### What you can do for pain safely while arranging care (if no contraindications)\n- **Acetaminophen (Tylenol)**: 650 mg every 6\u20138 hours as needed (max **3,000 mg/day** if you have no liver disease and aren\u2019t drinking heavily).\n- **Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin)**: 400 mg every 6\u20138 hours with food as needed (avoid if you have kidney disease, history of stomach ulcers/bleeding, are on blood thinners, or your surgeon told you not to use NSAIDs).\n- **Support the abdomen** when standing/coughing (gentle hand pressure or an abdominal binder if you were given one).\n- Avoid heavy lifting/straining; stay hydrated; consider a stool softener (e.g., polyethylene glycol/Miralax) if constipation is contributing.\n\n**Do not take leftover opioids from others** or exceed label dosing. Also, if the pain is severe enough that you feel you \u201cneed\u201d opioids again, that\u2019s another reason you should be examined rather than just refilled.\n\n### Clarifying questions (answering these will help triage)\n1. How severe is the pain (0\u201310), and is it getting worse day by day or sudden onset?\n2. Any **fever**, chills, nausea/vomiting, bloating, constipation, or inability to pass gas?\n3. Any **new bulge**, firmness, or swelling at the belly button or elsewhere? Any redness or drainage from incisions?\n4. Are you able to eat/drink? Does the pain change with movement, coughing, or lying flat?\n5. What pain meds were you prescribed, and have you taken any ibuprofen/naproxen or acetaminophen today?\n6. Any medical history that affects medication choice (ulcers/GERD, kidney disease, liver disease, blood thinners)?\n\nIf you reply with those details, I can help you decide whether this sounds more like expected post-op pain vs something that needs immediate ER evaluation\u2014but given your description of **severe sharp pain at 2 weeks**, I would not wait for a routine follow-up.",

The assistant who helped in the procedure didn't inform me of much. I am nervous I will get some sort of an infection not being able to take care of my teeth the way I want too,and also having wisdom teeth being pulled in a few days. Please help, thank you.",
