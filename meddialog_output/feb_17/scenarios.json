    "reference_doctor_response": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although a personal physical examination of the lump would be helpful in reaching a nearby diagnosis, most probably with a history of trauma, it could be an organised hematoma on the left side of your back. To confirm the diagnosis, if I were your doctor, I would go for an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) followed possibly by an excision biopsy depending on the report of the FNAC.  Considering the duration of more than 4 years, clinically it might be a benign lesion not to worry about. However, for cosmetic reasons it might be required to be taken out.Therefore, I would advise you to consult a general surgeon and get your self assessed for the same.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.Since you have not mentioned relevant history and description like sex, pattern of hair loss(patchy/diffuse), family history etc, its difficult to put a definitive diagnosis. Still, it seems you are suffering from either Androgenetic alopecia (due to hormones and genetically determined) or Telogen effluvium (Due to any recent stressful event or any other medical condition)If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma /illness/ stress/ medications etc, your menstrual history and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.Also some other special tests like trichogram and dermoscopy can aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals (Tab. Follihair new) for minimum 6 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum/gel containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera, Grocapix etc). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel. Avoid blow dryers and hair-color/dyes. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Please continue your inhaler therapy. Make sure your technique of using inhaler is correct. Personally I would suggest you to use metered dose inhaler with spacer device, which ensures maximum drug deposition into lungs.2. Were I treating you, I would add daily montelukast and cetirizine/levocetirizine to your regular treatment. This will improve your both rhinitis and asthma symptoms.3. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing. This will help you identifying substances you are allergic to. The Allergist may suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy which will improve your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms.4. It's great that you have quit smoking. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Personally I would suggest you to learn and perform regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama, which will improve your lung capacity.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (e.g., adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sprouts, etc.) will also be helpful to you in long run.Ass you have asked about allergy treatment center in Bangalore, I must say there are some very good Allergist-Immunologists in Bangalore at present. You may choose any one of them depending upon your ease of travel.However, personally I would suggest you Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) where a lot of Allergy-Immunology work is going.Well, allergy-asthma are very well manageable and most persons with allergy-asthma can live absolutely normal life with appropriate treatment. So I would suggest you not to get depressed and have a positive attitude and efforts towards your health.Hope My answer will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."

He did an ekg and found nothing wrong, but I didn;t think it was heart related. He said he thought the pain was due to me eating spicy food or hot sauce, because I liked it. I took his advice for a little while and stayed away from spicy food..that didn t help I eventually went back for an annual physical and at that time had issues with my grown, specifically my area of my left testicle...he had no idea what it could be as he could not find any issues, including a hernia. but sent me to a urologist. I saw 2 different ones in a years time...one had me take medication for a hydrocele he thought. Took the medication, pain subsided. the pain came back, I went back to the same urology office, but a new doctor saw me as the last one had retired. he said my file said nothing about a hydrocele, but actually said I had a hernia and recommended changes to my underwear and added support. I did that for some time and stayed away from strenuous activity. The pain never really subsided and in fact it spread to my hips and upper thighs. During this time I went back to that same uriolgoist office and saw a nurse practitioner. She found nothing of substance and sent me back to my primary, who did another exam and could find evidence of a hydricele OR hernia and recommended a CT scan of my pelvic area. I had that done about a year ago and it was inconclusive. the pain subsided in that time and so I have not gone back as I have gotten no answers really. The pain now resides in my groin/pelvis area, outside part fo the hip and now in my knees. Although I have had lower back pain in the past due to a fall many years ago, I had never felt the pain/discomfort i do now even when my lower back pain flared up. In fact, my back pain has not at all been a factor during this time. There are some other factors, but that is the main journey I have taken. I am reaching out as I had a couple more recent symptoms. Spontaneous bloody noses and loose bowel movements. With the pain expanding and the new symptoms I am becoming more concerned. what steps should I take next.",

They may  irradiate to both arms,  jaw and  last from 5 to 20 minutes. A typical heart pain and heart attack usauly affect older ages and persons whith different risk factors like hypertension,  diabetes, smokers and with hereditary of ischemic heart disease. As you are very young and you have not a typical pain the risk of heart attach is low (rare).In my opinion you have nothing to worry about becouse this pains are probably related to Gerd  or your costochondritis.GERD is quite known to give such pains like heart burning sensations.Anyway if this symtoms persist after treating GERD I will recomend to do some simple examinations like an electrocardiogram,  a cardiac echo and a strees test.

With the past history of recurrent abortions, hormonal imbalance should be suspected. Metformin corrects ovulation disturbances by maintaining insulin balance. Also, the causes for the abortions in the past should be known for further management.

So the spotting you are having could be due to this. And usually this type of spotting will subside soon if you continue the tablets. If the spotting persists, you may need additional dose of hormones to control it. You can complete the pack this month along with white non hormonal pills. Possibly you will get withdrawal bleeding while using the white pills. This will rule out the possibility of pregnancy and also helps in regularization of the cycles.

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello Thank you for trusting HCM There\u2019s no need to be alarmed if your semen comes out a yellowish color. In fact, it\u2019s very normal. As men get older the hue of the semen also changes. If you haven\u2019t had an ejaculation in a long time you could also experience a yellow tint to your semen. It\u2019s a good idea to take a leak before you engage in intercourse. When a man has an erection your urine stream is blocked, so that semen can pass through as the only discharge. However, traces of urine may leak through and cause you to have a more yellow ejaculate. Other reasons for yellow sperm are jaundice and leukocytospermia (high levels of white blood cells). These are normally accompanied by other bodily symptoms, so if you notice the yellow tint with abnormal symptoms, please consult a doctor.      Thank you"

So get done ECG first.If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. It might be muscular pain only.So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Start good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 3. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site."

    "patient_query": "My father aged 70 had a lacunar infaraction an year ago.After consulting a neurologist and taking few pills  he recovered 90 percent.But, he also developed server pain in the lower back and in the legs region, which is  causing extreme difficulty while walking.He however manages to walk a mile per day slowly.After consulting an orthopedican and getting an MRI done, he discovered that there is a disc bulge l4 l5  and thats causing the problem and suggested phisio-therpay as a solution. But phisiotherapy didnot work and he is still facing the same problem.When consulted with other doctors, they are of the opinion that it may be related to the brain or due to lacunar infaraction and not really anything to do with disc bulge l4 l5 ( herniated disc), or wear and tear in the spinal cord which is generally associated with this age. We are a kind of unsure as to whom to contact and how to proceed with medication. Please help as what can we do from here",
    "reference_doctor_response": "I would say that the pain is very unlikely to be related to the lacunar infarct. It is more likely due to degeneration of the spine, which is indeed age related. I would consider surgery an extreme last resort. But if physical therapy didn't work, then medications (like easy-to-tolerate pain killers like Tramadol or Nucynta) would help, as well as likely lumbar epidural steroid injections."

    "reference_doctor_response": "Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Since the condom got stuck in the vagina after the intercourse, it is possible for some spillage of semen to happen and if you happen to be in the fertile phase of the cycle, conception chances are high. Yet, use of emergency contraceptive pills should be restricted to only once or twice a year. This is because the high hormone content in the pill creates hormone disturbances and fertility problems in future.another way of emergency contraception is the insertion of an IUD soon after the intercourse to prevent implantation. Hope this helps."

Since then, ive had three bone fragments come out of my gum and my gum/bridge area feels like something needs to squish out of it.  It is uncomfortable 24/7, yet my dentist says everything has healed nicely and nothing shows on follow-up X-rays.  My dentist finally referred me to an established oral surgeon who took a 3-D xray and tells me I have sclerotic bone formation.  He gave me three steroid injections in my gum and that had no effect.  Now, he wants to cut my gum open for a look and inject steroid directly into the bone.  I am wary of this and can not find any information about this procedure.  Discussion with an additional dentist also confirmed that both dentists are not familiar with either my condition nor the proposed treatment.  Can you advise?",
    "reference_doctor_response": "Dear friend.Thanks for sharing your concern.Sclerotic bone formation is not normal bone formation pattern.That is not good quality bone which is required.It is brittle in nature and wears of fast giving less or no support to your roots.Therefore your oral surgeon wants to inject steroid directly at the site of bone formation and wants to see further results.It should recover after this procedure.Therefore in my view you can go for this treatment.Hope it helps.Thanks.Take care."

    "reference_doctor_response": "Treatment for CVID-1)Ig may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Solutions of 3-12% intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used on a regular basis to maintain a trough level of 400-500 mg/dL in adults. A dose of 400-600 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks is usually required. In patients with structural lung damage, a trough level of 700-800 mg/dL is required.2)Cyclosporin A has been successfully used in patients with CVID and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. The administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has been used to treat autoimmune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.3)Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated at the first sign of infection. A narrow spectrum of drugs should be used when culture and sensitivity results are available. The prophylactic use of antibiotics should be avoided because of an increased risk of infection with fungi or other resistant organisms.Specific therapy is often necessary to target the organ system involved. For instance, patients with chronic lung disease often develop airway obstructive disease that requires treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and other asthma medications4)Surgery is required to treat the complications of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Chronic sinusitis may require endoscopic sinus surgery. Severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia can be treated with splenectomy. Biopsy should be considered to exclude infection or malignancy in enlarging lymph nodes.If you have any doubts  let me know.Thanks"
