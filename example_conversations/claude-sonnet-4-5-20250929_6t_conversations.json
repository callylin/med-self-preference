The good news is that once he tapers off in the next week or two, his testosterone and sperm parameters should start recovering within 1-3 months.\n\n**My recommendation**: You can continue trying now if you'd like, but be aware conception might take a bit longer while he's still on the medication and for a few weeks after stopping. If you're not in a rush, waiting 4-6 weeks after he's completely off the oxycodone would give his system time to normalize and potentially improve your chances.\n\nIs there a particular reason you're hoping to conceive very soon, or would a short delay be acceptable?

Given that he has no prior fertility issues and conceived successfully before, his baseline fertility is likely good, which works in your favor. The fatigue being new since surgery strongly suggests it's medication- and recovery-related rather than a pre-existing problem.\n\n**Here's a balanced approach**: You can keep trying now\u2014there's no harm, and you might conceive despite the oxycodone. However, if you don't conceive this cycle, consider pausing for 4-6 weeks after he finishes tapering to let his hormone levels and sperm quality bounce back, which could shorten your overall time to pregnancy.\n\n**One practical tip**: Once he's off the oxycodone, maintaining good general health (adequate sleep, hydration, avoiding excessive heat to the groin area) supports faster recovery of sperm production.\n\nDoes this plan feel workable for you both, or do you have concerns about the timing?",

Also ask your doctor to check fasting insulin, glucose, and testosterone levels, as these guide treatment.\n\n**Two key questions:**\n- Do you have increased facial or body hair, or acne that worsened with the weight gain?\n- Has your husband had a semen analysis done? (Male factors account for about half of fertility issues, so both partners should be evaluated.)\n\nWith 2 years of trying and irregular cycles, you should see a fertility specialist or gynecologist experienced in PCOS soon\u2014treatments like ovulation-inducing medications (e.g., letrozole or clomiphene) plus lifestyle changes often help significantly.",

Since your last dose was this morning and you're having suggestive symptoms, getting that test done today is the right move.\n\n**Summary:** Your main possibilities are (1) early pregnancy from this cycle's attempt, or (2) premenstrual symptoms mimicking early pregnancy signs. The brief Primolut N exposure (days 16-25) is unlikely to cause harm if conception occurred before you started it, but stopping now is prudent until you know for certain.\n\n**Plan:** Test today, stop Primolut N regardless of result, call your fertility doctor with the outcome, and retest in 2-3 days if negative and period doesn't come. If you develop heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, seek urgent care.\n\nWishing you the best outcome\u2014let your fertility team guide the next steps once they know your pregnancy status.",

I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary. One toilet was clogged for nearly two months which I now know could have bred bacterial spores that cause tetanus infections. I cut myself shaving around 1 1/2 months ago. I was out of razors and used a razor that had been sitting in the bathroom with the clogged up toilet I mentioned above. I did clean the razor with rubbing alcohol before use however I had an open wound on my face for a while.. About a week. For about a month now I have been feeling extremely irritable, experiencing lockjaw symptoms, been short of breath, had fevers on and off, heart palpitations, and I have noticed that when I smile my face contorts into what one would call a sardonic smile. Am I going to die? Please let me know your opinion",

The facial contortion when you smile\u2014is this constant and involuntary, or does your face look normal at rest and only pulls oddly when you try to smile?\n\n3.

The tightness and facial pulling could have several causes (including anxiety-related muscle tension, TMJ issues, or even a nerve problem), but given the combination of symptoms you're describing, you still need an in-person exam today to be safe.\n\nBefore you go, three more questions:\n\n1. Have you had any muscle spasms elsewhere\u2014neck stiffness, back arching, or spasms in your arms or legs?\n\n2. Any trouble swallowing, drooling, or changes in your voice?\n\n3. You mentioned fevers on and off\u2014have you measured your temperature, and if so, what was the highest reading?\n\n**Plan:** Go to urgent care or an ED this afternoon. They can examine you, check for any neurological signs, and give you a tetanus booster if needed (which is safe even if you've had one before). If you develop worsening jaw stiffness, difficulty breathing, or severe muscle spasms, call 911 immediately.",

That doesn't mean we ignore it, but it's actually the *most likely* explanation here, not tetanus.\n\n**At urgent care, mention:** the shaving cut 6 weeks ago, your uncertain vaccine history, the jaw tightness (can open ~2 fingers), difficulty swallowing, and the feverish feeling. They'll take it from there.\n\n**Red flags\u2014call 911 if:** you suddenly can't open your mouth at all, develop severe neck stiffness or back arching, have trouble breathing, or experience violent muscle spasms.
