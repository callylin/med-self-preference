There's no evidence this medication in the father causes birth defects, so the timing is more about maximizing your chances of conception than safety concerns for the baby.\n\nOne last question: Are you currently taking prenatal vitamins with folic acid (ideally 400\u2013800 mcg daily)?

Most people clear it completely and have no long-term problems once treated.\n\n**What it is:** H. pylori is a bacteria that lives in the stomach lining and can cause ulcers or chronic inflammation (gastritis). If left untreated for many years, it slightly increases the risk of stomach ulcers and, rarely, stomach cancer\u2014but successful treatment eliminates these risks.\n\n**Your treatment:** The triple therapy you're on (clarithromycin, amoxicillin, omeprazole) is highly effective (80-90% cure rate). It's crucial to complete the full course (usually 10-14 days) even if you feel better.\n\n**After treatment:** You'll likely need a test 4+ weeks after finishing antibiotics to confirm eradication (usually a stool antigen or breath test).\n\nA few questions to help you:\n1. What symptoms led to your H. pylori testing\u2014stomach pain, nausea, or something else?\n2. Are you tolerating the antibiotics okay, or having side effects like diarrhea?\n3.
