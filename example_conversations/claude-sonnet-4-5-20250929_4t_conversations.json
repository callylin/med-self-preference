Just make sure you're taking prenatal vitamins with folic acid (at least 400-800 mcg daily) if you haven't started already.\n\nIs there anything else about conception planning or his recovery that you'd like to discuss?",

Practice slow breathing exercises when panic hits (breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6)\n3.
