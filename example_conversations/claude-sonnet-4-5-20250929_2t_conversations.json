I am wondering if this will have a negative impact on my pregnancy if I am pregnant because as explained we gave it a big try this time. Thank you in advance for your response. With my Best Regards; Mme Sue",

        "content": "I understand your concern about taking Primolut N while possibly being pregnant this cycle. First, let me reassure you that if conception occurred *before* you started the medication on day 16, the risk is likely very low\u2014early embryos aren't yet connected to your circulation in a way that would expose them significantly. However, norethisterone (the active ingredient) is generally avoided in confirmed pregnancy.\n\n**Here's what I recommend:**\n1. Take a sensitive home pregnancy test now (you're around day 25, so it should be accurate if you conceived this cycle)\n2. If positive, stop the Primolut N immediately and contact your fertility doctor today to discuss next steps\n3. If negative, complete the course as prescribed for your ICSI cycle timing\n\n**Questions to help me advise you better:**\n- What cycle day did you ovulate or have intercourse (was it before day 16)?\n- When is your period normally due?\n- Has your fertility doctor confirmed they know you were actively trying this cycle?",

I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary. One toilet was clogged for nearly two months which I now know could have bred bacterial spores that cause tetanus infections. I cut myself shaving around 1 1/2 months ago. I was out of razors and used a razor that had been sitting in the bathroom with the clogged up toilet I mentioned above. I did clean the razor with rubbing alcohol before use however I had an open wound on my face for a while.. About a week. For about a month now I have been feeling extremely irritable, experiencing lockjaw symptoms, been short of breath, had fevers on and off, heart palpitations, and I have noticed that when I smile my face contorts into what one would call a sardonic smile. Am I going to die? Please let me know your opinion",

        "content": "I understand you're very anxious, but let me reassure you: tetanus from a clogged toilet is extremely unlikely\u2014*Clostridium tetani* spores live in soil and rust, not typical bathroom environments, and cleaning the razor with alcohol would have helped. That said, some of your symptoms (lockjaw, difficulty smiling, fevers) need urgent evaluation to rule out any infection or other serious cause, even though true tetanus is rare and usually appears within days to two weeks of a wound.\n\n**Go to an urgent care or emergency department today.** They can examine you, check your vaccination status, and assess whether you need a tetanus booster or treatment for another condition. Anxiety can mimic or worsen many of these symptoms, but jaw stiffness and facial changes warrant a prompt in-person exam.\n\n**Three questions:**\n1. When was your last tetanus shot (Tdap or Td booster)?\n2. Can you open your mouth fully right now, or is it physically stuck/limited?\n3. Are you having any trouble swallowing or stiffness in your neck or back?",
