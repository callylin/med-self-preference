Let me ask a few questions to better understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, when you say the room is spinning, does this happen only when you move your head or change positions, or is it constant even when you're still? Also, have you had any recent ear infections, colds, or changes in your hearing?",

The fact that the spinning is triggered by head movements and position changes, combined with the fullness in your right ear, gives us some helpful clues.\n\nA few more questions: Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in that ear? Also, how old are you, and do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure? Have you been under unusual stress or had any recent head trauma?",

            "content": "This is helpful information. Based on what you've described - vertigo triggered by position changes, ear fullness, tinnitus (ringing), and being on blood pressure medication - there are a few possibilities I'm considering.\n\nThe most likely cause given your symptoms is Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), which is caused by small calcium crystals in the inner ear becoming dislodged. However, the combination of ear fullness and tinnitus could also suggest Meniere's disease or even an issue related to your blood pressure medication.\n\nHave you checked your blood pressure recently? Also, which blood pressure medication are you taking?",

            "content": "Given that your blood pressure is well-controlled and you've been stable on lisinopril for 2 years, the sudden onset of positional vertigo most likely points to BPPV. This is actually quite common and usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n1. Avoid sudden head movements for now\n2. When lying down, keep your head slightly elevated\n3. The Epley maneuver can help - I can explain this or you can find instructional videos\n4. Stay hydrated and avoid caffeine and alcohol\n\nHowever, I want you to seek immediate care if you develop: severe headache, difficulty speaking, facial drooping, or weakness on one side of your body. These could indicate something more serious.\n\nShould we discuss the Epley maneuver, or would you prefer to schedule a follow-up if symptoms don't improve in a few days?",
